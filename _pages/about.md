Hi, I am a Neurorehabilitation trainee pursuing a Ph.D. at The University of Texas at Austin. I am interested in how increasing inhibition of the procedural network in the brain can benefit patients with Alzheimer and Dementia disease. Specifically, I am exploring how the excitation of hippocampal network neurons can contribute to this process. To study this topic, I employ a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates techniques from behavioral science, physiology, and computational methods. I aim to shed light on this complex topic.

Previously, I earned my MS in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Ulsan, where I developed a machine learning model tailored for small devices like Arduino Uno to facilitate Electrooculography on an eye-tracking system. Furthermore, I have experience working on a project that involved decoding Electrocorticography data from epileptic patients using a machine learning model based on a semantic and gender hierarchy framework with 96% accuracy. With a BS in Computer Science and Engineering, my thesis work focused on creating a semi-automatic model to enhance natural language processing through ontology.

Outside of the lab, I am interested in participating in coding contests, cycling, and working on fun coding projects!
